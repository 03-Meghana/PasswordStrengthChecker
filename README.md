TASK NAME: Password Strength Checker

## DESCRIPTION 

A command-line tool that evaluates password strength using the `zxcvbn` algorithm. It provides visual feedback, pattern detection, crack time estimation, and audit logging‚Äîperfect for cybersecurity learners, developers, and anyone serious about credential hygiene.

## PLATFORMS USED

The development of the task was carried out using Visual Studio Code as the IDE, offering a flexible coding space with Python support. The final script is version-controlled and publicly accessible via a GitHub repository, allowing for collaborative feedback and potential community improvements.

## TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES

1. Python : The high-level programming language due to its clarity, rich libraries, and ease of use.
2. zxcvbn (python wrapper) : Password strength analysis using pattern recognition and crack time
3. getpass : Secure password input (hidden from screen)
4. datetime : Timestamping audit logs & password age tracking
5. Terminal-safe characters : Visual strength meter and feedback icons
6. Github : The completed tasks are stored in the repositoty.

## FUNCTIONALITY

The Password Strength Checker is a command-line cybersecurity tool designed to evaluate the robustness of user-entered passwords using intelligent pattern analysis and crack time estimation. Built in Python and powered by the zxcvbn library, it provides a score-based assessment, visual strength meter, and feedback on detected weaknesses such as dictionary words or predictable sequences. Users receive actionable suggestions to improve their passwords, along with tips on credential hygiene like avoiding clipboard use and rotating passwords regularly. The tool also includes optional password age tracking and audit logging, making it ideal for personal use, security training, or portfolio demonstration. Its lightweight design and professional output make it a practical and impactful utility for anyone serious about digital security.
